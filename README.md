# Skmer_Phylogeny_Scripts
1.script_appendix computes F matrix for all the taxa except for the diagonal x_ii values which are initially chosen 0.It computes according to the appendix. 

2.script_metin does the same thing except it follows Metin's idea. 

3.genome_handler.py generates a file containing number of A,T,C,G and sequence length of the genome files.

4.log_det.py calculates the distance matrix from F matrices of our GTR approach.
